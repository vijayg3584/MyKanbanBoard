		<p class="descpara">Kanban (literally signboard or billboard in
			Japanese) is a scheduling system for lean and just-in-time (JIT)
			production. Kanban is a system to control the logistical chain from a
			production point of view, and is an inventory control system. Kanban
			was developed by Taiichi Ohno, an industrial engineer at Toyota, as a
			system to improve and maintain a high level of production. Kanban is
			one method to achieve JIT. Kanban became an effective tool to support
			running a production system as a whole, and an excellent way to
			promote improvement. Problem areas are highlighted by reducing the
			number of kanban in circulation. One of the main benefits of kanban
			is to establish an upper limit to the work in progress inventory,
			avoiding overloading of the manufacturing system. Other systems with
			similar effect are for example CONWIP. A systematic study of various
			configurations of kanban systems, of which CONWIP is an important
			special case, can be found in Tayur (1993), among other papers.</p>

			A kanban board is one of the tools which can be used to implement the
			kanban method for a project.<br /> Kanban boards are perceived as a
			variation on traditional kanban cards. Instead of the signal cards
			that represent demand or capacity, the board utilizes magnets,
			plastic chips, colored washers or sticky notes to represent work
			items. Each of these objects represents an item in a production
			process as it moves around the board. Its movement corresponds with a
			manufacturing process. At it's simplest, the board is usually divided
			into three sections: "awaiting production", "work in progress" and
			"completed work". Complex Kanban boards can be created that visualize
			the flow of work across a value stream map. Employees move cards to
			the section on the board that coincides with the receptacle it
			represents.
