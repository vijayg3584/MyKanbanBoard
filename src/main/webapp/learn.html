    <h1 class="heading">Customer and Customer Group</h1>
    <h2 class="heading">In Connect2Yes</h2>
<p class="p1"> I checked with the help of Vinod when Customer Group is created. It gets created at the same time as Customer creation both in C2Y and Skeleton. There is no option to select Customer Group while creating Customer from C2Y. The Company details are used for Customer Group.</p>

    <h3 class="heading">In Skeleton</h3>
 <p class="p1">In Skeleton while creating a Customer users can choose an existing Customer Group during the acquisition deal creation. If no Customer Group is chosen it defaults to the Company/Person data based on whether the customer is private or company.</p>

    <h4 class="heading">Handling in Host2Host</h4> <!-- This is a comment -->
<p>During activation of connections in MCCS through the H2H process, there is a check to see if MCCS Number is present for a Customer Group. If no MCCS number is present a BT202 is invoked passing the customer details. In return a MCCS number is got which is updated in the Customer Group table.</p>
